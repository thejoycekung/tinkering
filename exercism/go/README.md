# Exercism Ã— Go

In this folder are the lessons/challenges I did as part of Exercism under the Go track to help me learn go.

Each folder consists of a `README.md` that explains the challenge, a series of tests in `_test.go` (and optionally cases in `cases.go`), and a `go.mod` file, all provided by Exercism.
