# tinkering

This is a public space for small stuff. These things might not go anywhere, may be forever unfinished, may never become anything useful (or usable).

Think of it more like a public notebook of scribbles and doodles, but with code. (And possibly money.)

\[And yes, I'm fully aware that that's what separate repos are for. But I feel like making a whole repo just to say 'Hello, outside' feels just a tad overkill. So have a palimpsest of a repo, instead.\]

Heavily inspired by [Evy's garden](https://evy.garden).
