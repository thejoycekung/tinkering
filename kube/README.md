# Kubernetes the Hard Way

Goal: Learn the basics of Kubernetes and how it works.

I first got inspired to find this after an interviewer recommended I get some experience with Kubernetes through some kind of homelab setup. They also mentioned that GCP has $300 in free credits for signing up, so I was pretty intrigued.

I'm still currently looking into the world of homelabs (I think they're absolutely wild) but finding Kubernetes resources online was somewhat easier.

I chose Kelsey's tutorial because he seems like a super reputable person in the community (with both knowledge of GCP and Kubernetes), and the fact that the tutorial takes advantage of this GCP free trial to help provision resources.

This tutorial was super helpful in not only teaching me how a cluster manages its connections between nodes, but also teaching me more about networking and Linux. I am realising I need more of that and it feels good to learn.

As of right now, my cluster has been up for 5 days, 3 hours, and 36 minutes, and I just finished the smoke test around half an hour ago. I'm not entirely sure whether I want to take down the cluster yet (maybe I'll find some obscure use for it?) but I'm really proud of everything I've learned so far.
